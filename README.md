# Private Events (Rails Associations)

> We built a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and sign to attendee an event. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

> A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users

> The main goal is to demonstrate mastering in building Rails Associations
